### Note

The Amber Electric API is returning strange (potentially inaccurate) data at the moment. This information should be as a point of interest, but nothing more. Some day, Amber Electric are releasing a new API - maybe they will fix the issue then. Who knows.

## Live Australian Electricity Pricing

You **do not** need to be an Amber Electric customer to see live pricing for your area.
This integration is great if you have a general interest in electricity pricing or renewables.
Uses your Home Assistant installation location (your latitude and longitude) to select the right electricity market and makes the data available to you to chart and use in automations.
